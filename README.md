# Hi there ğŸ‘‹


## ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on `fortnite.rs`, a library designed to make fortnite bots in Rust!

- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that could be a learning experience.
- ğŸ’¬ You can ask me about python issues or issues with fortnitepy (shotout to [terbau](https://github.com/Terbau) for making an amazing library).
- ğŸ“« You can contact me on discord as cup#9125.
